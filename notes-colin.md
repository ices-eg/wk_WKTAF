Feedback on:

1. Stockassessment.org models - break / stop if model fit is older than data changes
  - would be nice to send data and also send a messsage to run.  This would improve continuity.

2. 
  a. run taf.bootstrap automatically if committed changes are related to files in the bootstrap/ folder
  
  b. 
    - if bootstrap changed - run taf.bootstrap, data, model, output, report
    - utility - means rerun!
    - if data changed - run data, model, output, report
    - if model changed - run model, output report
    - etc.
  
3. Commit user results to Master branch?  This will allow us to check what the user gets versus what the server produces
  - possibly create a report of the diffs between user and taf results / changes

4. Provide a non-git / non-github methods to upload code and data

5. suggestion: only install r package, and do not refresh data or software

6. more workers working in parallel

7. job list / feedback about position in the queue

8. option to copy automatically from last year

9. potential for multiple runs / repos per stock

## Ideas for 'quality scoring' an assessment

* complete metadata (automatic)
* code comments and clarity / readability (human review)
* Before: After: match with what happens
* reviews / issues per stock on github?

## Ideas always wanted

if you want to contribute ideas and suggestions should we use Issues - or is there a better forum for this

Possibly a seperate repository for feedback and ideas?

Or a discussion board for those interested in taking part?
